# Application Forms

Heavily inspired from [Node.js Mentor Program by node-forward](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3aR7asv-flRgPTz7Csi9ILAGyPU2iGgid3OIOe7l9J8AxjA/viewform). The form is written with super sweet and friendly words, these forms should follow this path as well.

The program offers two form templates; one for the mentors, the other for the mentees.
  - For mentees: a form special for them is less scary and more inviting.
  - For mentors: we can ask more questions!

For convenience, Google forms is a good candidate to create the forms and store candidates.

- [\*1] A note will be added to express that the matching process might be slower for non english speakers due to possibility of lack of mentors/mantees in the desired language.

- [\*2] A note will be added to encourage the mentee to just write their thoughts. Their mentor will help them fine tune the goals they enrolled for.
