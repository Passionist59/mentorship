Feedback revolved around items in this issue: https://github.com/nodejs/mentorship/issues/14

Process:
- Send an email to applicants to thank them and inform them that we have recieved their form.
- Change application signup form:
  - List the scopes the mentees can join in the cohort, this way we can better match them to their interest. (suggested by Jennifer)
  - Follow up email when people submit the form, to know that we got form and they are listed.
  - Send an email to everyone that signed up already, ask them to fill the new form.

Duration:
- Preferred mentorship duration: 2-3 months

Time commitment:
- 1-2 hours per week for mentors
- Mentees need also to put additional time to work towards their mentorship goals and update their mentorship diary.

Channels:
- Slack, github, and Zoom are a good combination to achieve the goals of mentorship. No need to modify the channels.
