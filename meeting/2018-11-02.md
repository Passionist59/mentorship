**TOPIC**

Mentorship Team Meeting Notes

- @dshaw, @detrohutt, and @Bamieh have all had career/life changes going on
    - Haven't been able to commit to much more than attending the meetings
- We need to get a list of potential mentors for cohort 2 before we can start
- We need to also decide on a length of time for cohort 2
    - We should get feedback from current mentors to see their thoughts on duration
- Bi-weekly meetings between mentor/mentee seems to work well for LinkedIn and JSLA
- Could we revisit the idea of a rolling cohort?
    - Once we have a more stable, organized process, it may make more sense
    - We don't want to expect mentors to commit to multiple cohorts
    - We don't want to make mentors stop mentoring someone if it's still going well
- Consider "mentor mentors" to help mentor on being a leader, etc
- Our biggest challenge right now is lack of resources on the Mentorship Team
    - Let's use Node.js CommComm resources if we can to help organize and facilitate
- We should check in with Nick (EA)


**Action Items**

- @dshaw agreed to follow up with mhdawson regarding the issue creation script
- @dshaw agreed to reach out to Tracy Lee about attending the next meeting
- @detrohutt agreed to invite current program participants to a separate feedback meeting
