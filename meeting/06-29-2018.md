### Agenda

Extracted from mentorship-agenda labelled issues and pull requests from the mentorship repo prior to the meeting.

**TOPIC**

- nick will open an issue to outline the role of an education assistant
- nick is willing to commit to becoming an education assistant
- nick discussed what education assistant means:  while includes the roles of ( help coordinate the teachings / take feedback from mentees / help mentors to incorporate feedback  ).
- TA role means the mentees will ask the TA for things before reaching out to the mentor if needed. We agreed that we do not need this role since the mentorship is 1 on 1-3, the the capacity of the mentor should be enough
- bamieh will contact the general mentors asking them about being mentees for the first round in a selected WG
- we will require mentees in the first round to attend all WG meetings in that duration (generally once every 2 weeks)
- bamieh will be a mentee under dan for the first round
- we have to make sure we have enough diversity in our mentee selection although the number is small (female inclusive and geographical diversity)
- bamieh will open an issue to discuss the roles of the mentorship team, and if we should be delegating these roles from the start instead of having everyone do a little bit of everything
