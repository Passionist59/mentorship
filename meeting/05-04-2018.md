### Agenda
Extracted from mentorship-agenda labelled issues and pull requests from the mentorship repo prior to the meeting.




**TOPIC**

Each Mentor and mentee pair will have an issue in the project where they use it as a public record to their activity. The matching happens on github and the records are on github. This way we can utilize the the moderation teamâ€™s already established tools.

- 1 to many relation is not favored, due to lack of time and expectations and the nature of the aspired relation between metnor/mentee
- 1 to many relation is favored as we can cover more mentees in each round, 
 We need to select one and move forward, combination of two models can be done in future iterations of the program. Ben will open an issue for the 1-many. Bayo will open an issue for 1-1. To build consensus.
