### Agenda

Extracted from mentorship-agenda labelled issues and pull requests from the mentorship repo prior to the meeting.

- No official agenda items

**TOPIC**

- Matching process has started and first kickoff meeting is aug 1st
- What to discuss in kickoff meetings:
  -  Team member will outline the mentorship program process and make sure all below items are covered during meeting
  -  mentor explains the scope (s)he will be mentoring in
  -  find out what mentee wants to accomplish
  -  discuss mentee’s project’s scope
  -  Mentee sets expectations/goals (project-oriented/pr/etc)
  -  Pair should discuss availability and how to manage goal in 1 month
  -  Mentee should join WG meetings
  -  Discuss whether mentee and mentor are comfortable recording sessions and determine what should be confidential
  -  Agree on medium of communication
- No prescribed/required channel for communications between mentor and mentee
- Required progress issue for each mentor/mentee, they should log what happens and milestones reached so we can track progress and address/moderate issues that may arise
- Not mandatory but we ask that mentors record videos of sessions (with mentee’s permission)
  - Videos can be recorded/edited in any fashion but should be uploaded to YouTube so a link can be provided
  - Mentee can request any portion of video not be made public
  - Recording introductory mentoring videos can serve as an addition to docs for the different scopes, i.e. how the build process works
- It’s fine for mentor and mentee to meet more than the required times if they choose, only requirement being attendance of WG Meetings

**Action Items**

- Ahmad reached out to Nick, and may email him
- Ahmad will create an issue listing the roles of the mentorship program so team members can decide on what they’re interested in doing
- We should document the matching process so that it’s easier to onboard others to help facilitate it when needed
