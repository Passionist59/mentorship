# Kicking-off the mentorship program

To get started with the mentorship program, the following steps must be followed to move forward:

- [x] Mentorship program application form draft
    Check the [Application Forms][] for more details.

- [x] Finalize and reach consensus on the program structure and process.

    Opened an issue here and consensus is reached in the commcomm meetings. https://github.com/nodejs/mentorship/issues/2

- [x] Finalize Logistics (ie. forms to be filled in by mentees and mentors).
    Forms are created based on the [Application Forms][] guide. Created on google forms.
    - [Apply as a Mentor form][].
    - [Apply as a Mentee form][].

- [ ] Create a Slack channel for interested and nominated mentors and mentees, this
lowers the barrier for people to join, by increasing visibility of members and
show the activity of the program.

- [ ] Announce to all Node.js projects (i.e. node-core) about the availability of
the program, so they can reveal interest and goals in joining.


- [ ] Reach out to the mentors list in the node-forward mentors program:
https://github.com/node-forward/mentors

- [ ] Publicize the program through the Node.js ecosystem (Node.js Facebook pages,
blog articles, personal connections).

- [x] Update the readme files of the enrolled projects to encourage newcomers
to join the mentorship program.
    Check the main readme file of this repo.

### Future

After collecting a group of mentors and being confident in the mentorship
process, the program can advance to include the following:

- Coordinate mentorship events through platforms like [Outreachy][].

- Conferences and group mentorship programs.

- Widen the scope of the mentorship program.
