# Node.js Mentorship Program

An initiative to kick off node mentorship program (node ment)

## The goal of the mentorship program

Bring more contributors to NodeJS projects by mentoring people about node's environment and ecosystem, helping them in contributing to node, championing their PRs through code review and general help.

#### Benefits for mentors

- You will get to meet talented, driven people from across the nodeJS community.
- You will have the opportunity to practice mentoring people through guidance and communication, which is a valuable skill for any manager or a leader.
- You will show your commitment to help to the node OSS.
- You will be invited to node events at a discount, and might be invited to speak in some events.
- You might be invited to participate in group mentorship events and programs.
- You will be joining node's mentors team

#### Benefits for mentees

- You will receive personalized guidance to contribute to node and understand its ecosystem.
- You will grow your professional network.
- You will broaden your knowledge about node by connecting with someone outside your immediate work group.
- You will gain experience in contributing to OSS in general and node's contributing practices.
- You will recieve personalized help in understanding node's source code, and improving your programming skills.
- You will have an opportunity to work on soft skills such as communicating and problem solving.

##### Benefits for mentees

- General guidance (any topic related to node's ecosystem and javascript)
- Pair programming
- Code review
- Resume review


### Mindset

- **Growth Mindset** - A growth-mindset is required for change; if it feels overwhelming or scary, you are on the right track - keep going.
- **Start Small** - Activity begets activity. Let go of doing things right and start doing something. Little steps lead to big change.
- **We’re in this together** - If you feel stuck, reach out to someone for support; lean on the mentorship community.

### Relationship

- **It’s a two way street** - Mentees lead, mentors guide, but both are active participants. Mentoring sets mutual responsibilities and accountability.
- **Mentorship is an investment** - Mentorship is an investment for both mentees and mentors; you get out of it what you put in.
- **A foundation of trust is essential** - Mentoring requires a trusting, confidential relationship based on mutual respect. Consistency is key - Scheduled, consistent meetings are an important part of building the mentorship relationship.

### Mentee-specific

- **Goal setting is worth the time** - Goal setting is an iterative process; mentees should “raise the bar” for themselves as they progress and their skills increase. Take time to reflect on progress and celebrate small wins.
- **Give yourself permission to focus on your career** - It is hard to set aside time to focus on your career, but it’s important! You have permission to focus on your career.

### Mentor-specific

- **Mentors guide** - Mentors make themselves available to their mentees and they actively listen. Guidance includes sharing experiences, past or present, and how mentors dealt with a particular challenge or situation.
- **Mentors are a connection point** - Mentors connect mentees with people and resources (e.g. articles, classes). Mentors aren’t expected to know all the answers. A mentor’s job should be to help mentees work through problems, not always being or finding the solution themselves.


# The Mentroship Program Structure

The mentorship duration will be 6 months, during which the mentor will provide guidance and help to the mantee on an agreed schedule.

## Process

_*Inspired by [kubernetes pilot prorgam](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bRjDEPEn3autWzaEFirbLfHagbZV04Q9kTCalYmnnXw/edit#slide=id.g2900d0522b_0_76)*_

### Matching

Before the program starts, mentees will fill out a survey indicating the areas of focus they’d like to work on. Mentors will fill out a similar survey indicating the areas they feel comfortable advising on. This information will be used to pair people.


### Kickoff

A kickoff email will be sent informing the mentor and mentee about their pair up. A meeting will be scheduled to introduce them to each other, set a schedule, expectations and goals.

In their first meeting, pairs should decide on a method for scheduling future meetings. They should also decide on what should be held confidential and what can be shared outside the relationship.


### Regular Mentor/Mentee Meetings (6 months)

Mentors and mentees will meet for **at least an hour every month** for the following 6 months 
Ongoing Support for mentors and mentees. In addition to the meetings, the mentor should champion any PR submitted by the mentee during the mentership program in the node project.

- Slack channels for mentors and mentees to create a space for conversation, encouragement and learnings.


### Expectations

The mentoring relationship should be **\*mentee-driven and mentor-guided***. The mentee is expected to identify and drive activity towards his or her career goals. Effective mentorship is built on a solid relationship between the mentor and mentee, so take time to get to know each other, exploring passions and obstacles as they could become relevant (if not already so) to the areas of focus.

**Requirements for mentors:**

- Attend the kickoff meeting.
- Help their mentees refine their goals during the first week of the program.
- Meet with their mentee for at least one hour every month for 6 months.

**Requirements for mentees:**

- Attend the kickoff meeting.
- Identify 1-3 career goals.
- Meet with their mentor for at least one hour every three weeks.
- Drive activity towards career goals (have a “growth attitude”).


### Accounting for language diversity

To account for language diversity during the pairing phase, the form will include the following:
- The preferred language of the mentee/mentor 
- The fluency in speaking/understanding english
- The mentee/mentor restrictly requires a non-english language for communication.
- a notice that restricting the language might result in a slower pairing process.

### Displaying the list of mentors and mentees

Initially in the program's github page, and asking candidates to join the slack channel to reach out and meet people over specific channels.

### What is the communication channel to be used for communication between mentors/mentees?
Slack is used as a channel for the initial meeting, then the pair can decide as they see fit.

### Duration of the mentorship program for the paired up mentor/mentee
6 months


## kick off the mentorship program

1. Finalize and reach consensus on the program structure and process.
2. Finalize Logistsics (ie. forms to be filled by mentees and mentors).
3. Create a slack channel for interested and joined mentors and mentees, this lowers the barrier for people to join, by increasing visiblity of members and show the activity of the program.
4. Announce to all node projcets (ie node-core) about the availability of the program, so they can reveal interest and goals in joining.
5. Reach out to the mentors list in the node-forward mentors program: https://github.com/node-forward/mentors
6. Publicize the program through the node ecosystem (node facebook pages, blog articles, personal connections)
