# Step 4: Creating the Application (Week 4)

## Motivation
It is the responsibility of the MI to turn the rough version of the gathered requirements into an official Initiative Application, to be filled out by anyone interested in joining the participating Initiative.

## Procedure
After the meeting, the MI will use the gathered requirements to craft a Initiative Application using aidaform.com.

## Notes
* We have yet to create a Initiative Application that involves a code challenge but are currently working on such a Initiative Application.
