# Step 2: Opening Dialogue (Week 2)

## Motivation
There is a lot of communication involved in creating a Position and finding and onboarding a Mentee. We need a form of communication that is searchable, organized, and focused so that it doesnâ€™t become cumbersome to work with several Initiatives at once.

## Procedure

Once a group has confirmed interest in participating in the Program, the MI will create a working document on Google Drive. Once created, all written communication between the MI and participating group will be handled through this document.

## Notes
* Is there a reason for video calls in some cases?
